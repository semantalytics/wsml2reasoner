The Web Service Modeling Language (WSML) is a language for the
specification of various aspects of Semantic Web Services (SWS),
such as what functionality is provided by a SWS or how to interact
with the SWS. It provides a formal language for the Web Service
Modeling Ontology (WSMO) and is based on well-known logic-based
knowledge representation (KR) formalisms (i.e. Description Logics
and Logic Programming), specifying one coherent language framework
for the semantic description of Web Services. The least expressive
core language represents conceptually the intersection of the two
KR formalisms Datalog and the Description Logic $\mathcal{SHIQ}(\mathbf{D)}$.
This core language is extended in the directions of Description
Logics and Logic Programming in a principled manner with strict
layering.

%WSML distinguishes between
%conceptual and logical modeling in order to support users who are
%not familiar with formal logic, while not restricting the
%expressive power of the language  for the expert user.
Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRIs) play a central role
in WSML as identifiers. The concept of namespaces is used for
logically grouping symbols in a vocabulary. Furthermore, WSML
defines XML and RDF serializations for inter-operation over the
Semantic Web. Thus, WSML is a Web and Semantic Web compliant KR
language.

Although WSML takes into account all aspects of Web Service
description identified by WSMO (i.e. Web services, goals,
mediators and ontologies) we focus in the following on the WSML
ontology description (sub)language. Reasoning with other elements
of WSMO (e.g. matching of two Web Service capability descriptions)
fundamentally relies on ontology reasoning in WSML and is reduced
to ontology reasoning whenever this is possible.

WSML makes a clear distinction between the modeling of the
different conceptual elements on the one hand and the
specification of complex logical definitions on the other. To this
end, the WSML syntax is split into two parts: the conceptual
syntax and logical expression syntax. The conceptual syntax was
developed from the user perspective, and is independent from the
particular underlying logic; it shields the user from the
peculiarities of the underlying logic. Having such a conceptual
syntax allows for easy adoption of the language, since it allows
for an intuitive understanding of the language for people not
familiar with logical languages. In case the full power of the
underlying logic is required, the logical expression syntax can be
used. There are several entry points for logical expressions in
the conceptual syntax, e.g. axioms in ontologies or capability
descriptions in Goals and Web Services.

\paragraph{A. Conceptual Syntax --}
%\subsection{Conceptual Syntax}
\label{sec:conceptual-syntax}

The WSML conceptual syntax for ontologies essentially allows for
the modeling of concepts, instances, relations and relation
instances. Additionally, each of this modelling elements may have
non-functional properties (describing meta-information about the
element, such as the author or version etc.). An ontology may
import other ontologies. We illustrate the description of WSML
ontologies with an example in Listing
\ref{lst:wsml-ontology-example} and discuss its modeling elements
below.

\subparagraph{\it \bfseries (1) Concepts \& Relations.} The notion of concepts
(or classes) plays a central role in ontologies. Concepts form the
basic terminology of the domain of discourse. A concept may have
instances and may have a number of attributes associated with it.
Non-functional properties as well
as attribute definitions are grouped together in one frame (e.g.
concept \syn{ITBundle} in Listing \ref{lst:wsml-ontology-example}
representing a product bundle (provided by
a telecom provider) that consists up to one online network
connection and up-to one online service which can be used over the
network connection.)

Attribute definitions can take two forms, namely \emph{constraining}
(using \synkw{ofType}) and \emph{inferring} (using
\synkw{impliesType}) attribute definitions\footnote{The distinction
  between inferring and constraining attribute definitions is
  explained in more detail in \cite[Section
  2]{Bruijn+PolleresETAL-:05}}. Constraining attribute definitions
define a typing constraint on the values for this attribute, similar
to integrity constraints in databases; inferring attribute
definitions allow that the type of the values for the attribute is
inferred from the attribute definition, similar to range
restrictions on properties in
RDFS~\cite{Brickley+Guha-VocaDescLang:03} and
OWL~\cite{Dean+Schreiber-OntoLangRefe:04}.  Each attribute
definition may have a number of features associated with it, namely,
transitivity, symmetry, reflexivity, and the inverse of an
attribute, as well as minimal and maximal cardinality constraints.
In Listing~\ref{lst:wsml-ontology-example}, e.g concept \syn{Product}
is defined to have an attribute \syn{hasProvider} which is
considered as the inverse of the attribute \syn{provides} in concept \syn{Provider}.
Furthermore, it is allowed to infer for values of \syn{hasProvider} of
\syn{Product}-instances to be instances of \syn{Provider}.
As opposed to features of roles in Description Logics, attribute features
such as transitivity, symmetry, reflexivity and inverse attributes are local
to a concept in WSML.
%For a motivation on the use of constraining attributes, see \cite{Bruijn+PolleresETAL-:05}.

Similar constructs are available to define ($n$-ary) relations (denoting
logical inter-relation between individuals and values) in WSML
ontologies.
\\ {\it \bfseries (2) Instances of Concepts and Relations.}
Concepts and relations may have a arbitrary number of
instances associated with it. Instances explicitly specified in an
ontology are those which are shared as part of the ontology. An
instance may be member of zero or more concepts (or relations) and may have a
number of attribute values associated with it, see for example the
instance \syn{MyBundle} in Listing
\ref{lst:wsml-ontology-example} that is an \syn{MyBundle} provided by the \syn{GermanTelekom}.
In WSML that the specification of
concept membership for instances is optional and the attributes
used in the instance specification do not necessarily have to
occur in the associated concept definition. Consequently, WSML
instances can be used to represent semi-structured data.
%, since without concept membership and constraints on the use of
%attributes, instances form a directed labelled graph. Because of
%this possibility to capture semi-structured data, most RDF graphs
%can be represented as WSML instance data, and vice versa.
\\ {\it \bfseries (3) Axioms.} Axioms provide a means to add arbitrary
logical expressions to an ontology. Such logical expressions can
be used to refine concept or relation definitions in the ontology,
but also to add arbitrary axiomatic domain knowledge or express
constraints.
For exampe, a \syn{SharePriceFeed} instances represent financial services
that report in real-time of current prices of certain shares
at the stock-market. Thus, a certain bandwidth is required, which
is captured by axiom \syn{SharePriceFeed\_requires\_bandwidth}
in Listing \ref{lst:wsml-ontology-example}: it states that the
ontology may not contain an instance of \syn{ITBundle} that
provides a \syn{SharePriceFeed} online services over a network
which can only provide a bandwith under a certain limit (here
\syn{512}). Other examples are axiom \syn{DialupConnection\_DSLConnection\_Disjoint}
stating there can not be an object which is a dial-up
connection and a DSL connection at the same time, or axiom
\syn{BroadbandBundle\_sufficient\_condition} which specifies that
any ITBundle that provides a DSLConnection as its
network connection actually is a BroadbandBundle. Thus, the latter
axiom together with the (partial) definition of concept
\syn{BroadbandBundle} provides an exact characterization of the
instances of this class.

\paragraph{B. Logical Expression Syntax --}
%\subsection{Logical Expression Syntax}
\label{sec:log-expr-syntax}

We will first explain the general logical expression syntax, which
encompasses all WSML variants, and then describe the restrictions on
this general syntax for each of the variants. The general logical
expression syntax for WSML has a First-Order Logic (FOL) style, in the
sense that it has constants, function symbols, variables, predicates
and the usual logical connectives. WSML provides F-Logic
\cite{Kifer+LausenETAL-LogiFounObjeFram:95} based extensions in
order to model concepts, attributes, attribute definitions, and
subconcept and instance relationships. Finally, WSML has a
number of connectives to facilitate the Logic Programming based
variants, namely default negation (negation-as-failure),
LP-implication (which differs from classical implication) and
database-style integrity constraints.

Variables in WSML start with a question mark.
Terms are either identifiers, variables, or constructed terms. As usual, an
atom is constituted of an $n$-ary predicate symbol with $n$ terms as
arguments. Besides these standard atoms of FOL, WSML has a two special kind of
atoms, called \emph{molecules}, which are inspired by F-Logic and can be used
to capture information about concepts, instances, attributes and attribute
values:
(a) An {\bfseries \emph{isa}-molecule} is an expression of
  the form \syn{\emph{A} \synkw{memberOf} \emph{B}} (denoting a concept membership)
  or of the form \syn{\emph{A} \synkw{subConceptOf} \emph{B}}
  (denoting a subconcept relationship)
  whereby \syn{\emph{A}} and \syn{\emph{B}} are arbitrary
  terms.
(b) An {\bfseries  \emph{object}-molecule} is an expression of the form
   \syn{\emph{A}[\emph{B} \synkw{hasValue} \emph{C}]} (denoting attribute values of objects),
   of the form \syn{\emph{A}[\emph{B} \synkw{ofType} \emph{C}]} (denoting a
  constraining attribute signature), or of the form
  \syn{\emph{A}[\emph{B} \synkw{ofType} \emph{C}]} (denoting an inferring attribute signature), with
  \syn{\emph{A,B,C}} being arbitrary terms.

WSML has the usual first-order connectives: the unary negation
operator \synkw{neg}, and the binary operators for conjunction
\synkw{and}, disjunction \synkw{or}, right implication
\synkw{implies}, left implication \synkw{impliedBy}, and bi-implication
\synkw{equivalent}. Variables may be universally
quantified using \synkw{forall} or existentially quantified using
\synkw{exists}. First-order formulae are obtained by combining atoms
using the mentioned connectives in the usual way.
%The following are
%examples of First-Order formulae in WSML:
%
%\begin{lstlisting}[style=wsml, frame=none]
%//every person has a father
%forall ?x (?x memberOf Person implies exists ?y (?x[father hasValue
%?y])).
%//john is member of a class which has some attribute called 'name'
%exists ?x,?y (john memberOf ?x and ?x[name ofType ?y]).
%\end{lstlisting}

Apart from First-Order formulae, WSML allows the use of the
negation-as-failure symbol \synkw{naf} on atoms, the special Logic
Programming implication symbol \synkw{:-} and the integrity
constraint symbol \synkw{!-}. A logic programming rule consists of a
\emph{head} and a \emph{body}, separated by the \synkw{:-} symbol.
An integrity constraint consists of the symbol \synkw{!-} followed
by a rule body. Negation-as-failure \synkw{naf} is only allowed to
occur in the body of a Logic Programming rule or an integrity
constraint. The further use of logical connectives in Logic
Programming rules is restricted. The following logical connectives
are allowed in the head of a rule: \synkw{and}, \synkw{implies},
\synkw{impliedBy}, and \synkw{equivalent}. The following connectives
are allowed in the body of a rule (or constraint): \synkw{and},
\synkw{or}, and \synkw{naf}.
%The following are examples of LP rules
%and database constraints:
%
%\begin{lstlisting}[style=wsml, frame=none]
%//every person has a father
%?x[father hasValue f(?y)] :- ?x memberOf Person.
%//Man and Woman are disjoint
%!- ?x memberOf Man and ?x memberOf Woman.
%//in case a person is not involved in a marriage, the person is a bachelor
%?x memberOf Bachelor :- ?x memberOf Person and naf
%Marriage(?x,?y,?z).
%\end{lstlisting}

Axioms \syn{BroadbandBundle\_sufficient\_condition} and
\syn{SharePriceFeed\_requires\_bandwidth} in Listing~\ref{lst:wsml-ontology-example}
are examples for the use of LP rules and integrity constraints in
WSML ontologies.

%\subsection{Particularities of the WSML Variants}
\paragraph{C. Particularities of the WSML Variants --}
Each of the WSML variants defines a number of restrictions on the
logical expression syntax. For example, LP rules and constraints
are not allowed in WSML-Core and WSML-DL. Table
\ref{table:wsml-matrix} presents a number of language features and
indicates in which variant the feature can occur.

\caption{WSML Variants and Feature Matrix} \label{table:wsml-matrix}
\end{table}
}

\noindent {\sl \bfseries WSML-Core}  allows only first-order
formulae which can be translated to the DLP subset of
$\mathcal{SHIQ}(\mathbf{D)}$~\cite{Grosof+HorrocksETAL-DescLogiProg:03}. This subset is very
close to the 2-variable fragment of First-Order Logic, restricted
to Horn logic. Although WSML-Core might appear in the Table
\ref{table:wsml-matrix} featureless, it captures most of the
conceptual model of WSML, but has only limited expressiveness
within the logical expressions.
\\
{\sl \bfseries WSML-DL} allows first-order formulae which can be
translated to $\mathcal{SHIQ}(\mathbf{D)}$. This subset is very
close to the 2-variable fragment of First-Order Logic. Thus, WSML
DL allows classical negation, and disjunction and existential
quantification in the heads of implications.
\\
{\sl \bfseries WSML-Flight} extends the set of formulae allowed
in WSML-Core by allowing variables in place of instance, concept
and attribute identifiers and by allowing relations of arbitrary
arity. In fact, any such formula is allowed in the head of a
WSML-Flight rule. The body of a WSML-Flight rule allows
conjunction, disjunction and default negation. The head and body
are separated by the LP implication symbol. WSML-Flight
additionally allows meta-modeling (e.g., classes-as-instances) and
 reasoning over the signature, because variables are allowed to
occur in place of concept and attribute names.
\\
{\sl \bfseries WSML-Rule} extends WSML-Flight by allowing
function symbols and unsafe rules, i.e., variables which occur in
the head or in a negative body literal do not need to occur in a
positive body literal.
\\
{\sl \bfseries WSML-Full} The logical syntax of WSML-Full is
equivalent to the general logical expression syntax of WSML and
allows the full expressiveness of all other WSML variants.

%Part of the conceptual syntax for ontologies has an equivalent in
%the logical syntax. This correspondence is used to define the
%semantics of the conceptual syntax. Notice that, since only parts
%of the conceptual syntax are mapped to the logical syntax, only a
%part of the conceptual syntax has a semantics in the logical
%language for ontologies. For example, non-functional properties
%are not translated, since they represent only meta-information of
