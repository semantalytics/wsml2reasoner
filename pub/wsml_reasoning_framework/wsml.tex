\section{Reasoning in the WSML Language\label{sec:wsml}}
-- give an overview of the WSML language; focus on semantics of rule-based variants (also show how syntax looks like, e.g. by an example) \\
-- focus on the ontology language part of WSML (only briefly mention WS-specific parts) and sketch its features, such as constraints, datatypes, conceptual modelling + axiomatic formulations, ... \\
-- describe the reasoning tasks in WSML, i.e. KB satisfiability and entailment \\
-- relate language features and reasoning, e.g. constraints and satisfiability, to emphasise the close connection of these features to reasoning \\
