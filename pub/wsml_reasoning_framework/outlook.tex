\section{Conclusion \& Outlook\label{sec:outlook}}
In this paper, we presented a transformational framework that
enables us to perform important reasoning tasks for rule-based
WSML. The key features of the framework are: (1) (2) ...
Eventually, the available implementation of the system based on
datalog components such as KAON2 and MINS represent the first
available reasoning systems for WSML. The presented framework
proved to be a flexible and effective way to build reasoners for
WSML based on existing, well-designed and efficient systems in a
short period of time.

Currently, the framework as well as our implementation focuses on
WSML Core, Flight and Rule, However efforts are ongoing to extend
this into the direction of WSML DL and WSML Full.

The following extensions to the framework are desirable:

Another candidate for extension of language support is DLV
(disjunctive datalog with default negation (under stable model
semantics, which is fine for the stratified case), but poor in
datatypes) and KRHyper (disjunctive logic programs with default
negation in the stratified case). Hence DLV could be used for
supporting WSML-DL reasoning in the precense of WSML-Flight rules
whereas KRHyper could be used to reason with WSML-DL extended by
WSML-Rule rules in the stratified case.

The generic and flexible architecture of the framework, allows.
