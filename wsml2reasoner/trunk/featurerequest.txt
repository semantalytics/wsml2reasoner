#1
 - better handling of constraint violations

#2
 - define query syntax and implement corresponding validator.
 (i.e. need a variable or don't need a variabel and a coresponding validator).
 
#3
Boris Danev:
 - support for path expressions (low prioirty!)
 
#4
Boris Danev:
 - query support for retrieve only direct subclasses 
 
#5
Boris Danev:
 - Anonymous or don't Care variables: 
 A nice feature for query support will be the 'exists'
 Forall task,v ?task[hasName hasValue ?v] and exists ?R ?task[relatedTo hasValue ?R]
 In this case I do not want in my result tuples the ?R variable

#6
Jos:
loyd topper is not supported for exists in rule body for existentials.

#7 
Jos:
Unsafe rules for wsml rule

#8
Jos:
Variable Binding Results have unituitive (no) ordering.

#9
Boris Danev:
more fine grained control over reregister procedure of ontology:
//insertion of an instance of a concept or relation
addInstance("instance Dave memberOf Human"); 
//modifies or inserts the hasName value to an already existing instance).
updateInstance("uri#Dave[hasName hasValue \"Dave\"]"). 
//deletes the instance with name Dave
removeInstance("uri#Dave"); 

This should not be that difficult I think because it does not changes the ontology. Of course checking with cardinalities, other rules, axioms must be performed to ensure successful insertion.
