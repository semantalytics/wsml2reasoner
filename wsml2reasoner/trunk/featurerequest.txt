General:
 - better handling of constraint violations
 
Boris Danev:
 - support for path expressions
 - retrieve only direct subclasses
 - Anonymous or don't Care variabkes:

 Forall task,v ?task[hasName hasValue ?v] and exists ?R ?task[relatedTo hasValue ?R]
 In this case I do not want in my result tuples the ?R variable
