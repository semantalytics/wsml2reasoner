\subsection{Mapping WSML Reasoning Tasks to Datalog Querying}
-- describe how to realise WSML satisfiability and entailment through datalog querying \\
-- -- characterize the KB (datalog program) on which reasoning is performed with the different facts and rules  \\
-- -- show how the WSML reasoning tasks are mapped to datalog queries (KB sat., entailment and conjunctive query answering) \\

To perform reasoning over the original WSML ontology $O$ with an
underlying datalog inference engine, a datalog program
\begin{displaymath}
    P_O = \mlaxioms \cup \tau(O)
\end{displaymath}
is build up, consisting of the meta-level axioms togeter with the
transformed ontology. The different WSML reasoning tasks are then
realized by performing datalog queries on $P_O$, as follows.
\begin{small}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
  \hline
  $O$ is satisfiable & $(P_O, \qury \dlognot \square) \rightarrow \top$ \\
  $O \models \phi(\vec{C})$ & $(P_O, \qury \phi(\vec{C})) \rightarrow \top$ \\
  $\{\vec{X} : O \models Q(\vec{X})\}$ & $\{\vec{X} : (P_O, \qury Q(\vec{X})) \rightarrow \top\}$ \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{small}

( $\phi_g$ : ground fact ; $\vec{X}$ : variable binding )
