\section{Reasoning Framework Overview\label{sec:framework}}

\subsection{Architecture and Internal Layering}
-- present a picture that shows the layering of the framework's internal components \\
-- emphasise the high modularisation w.r.t. use of external inference engines and also internal extendibility \\

\subsection{Interface and Integration with Existing Technology}
-- mention the connection to the WSMO4J project via the use of the API \\
-- say something about the integrated/supported inference engines KAON2 and MINS \\
