%The use of ontology languages for semantically annotating Web
%Services demands for reasoning support in order to facilitate
%tasks like automated discovery or composition of services based on
%semantic descriptions of their functionality.
WSML is an ontology language specifically tailored to annotate Web
Services, and part of its semantics adheres to the rule-based
knowledge representation paradigm of logic programming. We present a
framework to support reasoning with rule-based WSML language
variants based on existing Datalog inference engines. Therein, the
WSML reasoning tasks of knowledge base satisfiability and instance
retrieval are implemented through a language mapping to Datalog
rules and Datalog querying. Part of the WSML semantics is realized
by a fixed set of rules that form meta-level axioms. Furthermore,
the framework exhibits some debugging functionality that allows for
identifying violated constraints and for pointing out involved
instances and problem types. Its highly modular architecture
facilitates easy extensibility towards other language variants and
additional features. The available implementation of the framework
provides the first reasoners for the WSML language.
